Q: Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.

The comma (,) operator evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last 
operand. 

let x = 5;

x = (x++, x);

console.log(x);
// Expected output: 6

x = (3, 4);

console.log(x);
//Expected output 4

it also used to print multiple values
let a =3,b=4,c=5;
console.log(a,b,c)
